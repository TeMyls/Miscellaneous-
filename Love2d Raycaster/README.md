# Raycasting 
Raycasting is an old technique used to render a fake 3d environment from a map in the form of a array.

<br />This technique uses an extremely fast algorithm know. as Digital Differential Analyser or the DDA Algorithm.
<br />It's done by projecting lines or rays from the position of the player in the map until they collide with a wall, which is represented by a number in the array. Then the distance is used to project lines or rectangles of various sizes onto the screen. This simulates 3d. 


# Articles
<br /> I learned the most from this tutorial, as I translated alot of code from Javascript to lua and watched/read alot to understand concepts
<br />["Vinicius Biavatti's Tutorial"](https://github.com/vinibiavatti1/RayCastingTutorial)
<br /> This one is far more conceptual 
<br />["Permadi's Tutorial"](https://permadi.com/1996/05/ray-casting-tutorial-table-of-contents/)
<br /> This one helped alot aswell.

# Basic Dungeon Generation
First using my implementation of the ![Binary Space Partitioning Algorithm]. I split a 2d array into multiple subsections.<br />

Then within those subsections, a room of a random width and height is placed and tunnels are generating connecting the rooms<br />

You may have noticed there are two testmap files, the main difference between the two is the method of tunnel generation.<br />

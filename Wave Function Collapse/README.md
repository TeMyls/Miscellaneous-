# Wave Function Collapse
A great resource for understanding the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm is [video](https://youtu.be/2SuvO4Gi7uY?si=6FCXBzKSAgtEShIk)



The wave function collapse algoritm can best be described by the puzzle game of sudoku. <br />

Each cell in every row or column can only have one of a finite arrangement of numbers ranging 1 through 9. In the 3 by 3 sections in 9 by 9 grid of a normal sudoku game, if a random cell has a 9 then the entire 3 by 3 section and any cells along the cell's row and column containing the the number cannot have any 9s,limiting the other cells options to remaining cells 1 through 8.<br />
Having 9 present limits ,or __collapses__, the randomness, or __entropy__, of the cells in the 9 by 9 section and its row and column.<br />

Say we have 5 cells in the shape of a plus sign with two numbers,9 and 5 each perpendicular to each other on the arms of the plus sign, with only 9 the remaining possible cells in the 3 by 3 section and along it's row and column are 1 through 8, with a 5 added the possible number in the cells directly adjecent to 5 and 9 and in the 3 by 3 section would be 1 through 4 and 6 through 8,thus having 5 an 9 collapsing the possiblities. <br />

With more and more numbers added, the amount of possiblies decreases to a point where only one or very few options are left to choose, and so the guessing game begins.

# Wave Function Collapse
A great resource for understanding the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm is [video](https://youtu.be/2SuvO4Gi7uY?si=6FCXBzKSAgtEShIk)

The wave function collapse algoritm can best be described by the puzzle game of sudoku. Where each cell in every row or column can only have one of a finite arrangement of numbers ranging 1 through 9. In the 3 x 3 sections containing 9x9 cells of a normal sudoku game, if a random row or column has a 9 then the entire 9x9 section and any cells along the row and column of the entire grid containing the the number cannot have any 9s, so with this the any of the cells along the row and column can be any remaining cells 1 through 8. Say we have 5 cells in the shape of a plus sign with two numbers,9 and 5 each perpendicular to each other on the arms of the plus sign, with only 9 the remaining cells 1 through 8 with a 5 added the possible cells would be 1 through 4 and 6 through 8,thus having 5 an 9 present limits or __collapses__ the current possibility of the cells adjcent to them.
